</blockquote>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">SIMULTANEOUS</span> effort is this
day being made in this parish, by ministers of various sections
of the one Church of Christ, to direct public attention to a
question of no ordinary magnitude, with which the cause of
national righteousness is identified; and to stir up the
community to unite in vigorous, yet peaceful opposition to a
project, which involves the perpetration of a great national
sin.</p>
<p>Most of those now present have gazed with admiration on the
marvels of the memorable and magnificent Crystal Palace of 1851,
the design of which originated with the same Prince who, in <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>his homage to
the Supreme Ruler of nations, had previously suggested as an
appropriate motto for our Royal Exchange the words now graven on
its pediment: &ldquo;The earth is the Lord&rsquo;s, and the
fulness thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in beautiful harmony with
this recognition of the sovereignty of Heaven, and it formed one
of its most gratifying features, that the doors of the Crystal
Palace were closed on the Lord&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; England thus
solemnly proclaimed to assembled nations that she exalted the
spiritual above the material&mdash;the eternal above the
temporal&mdash;the immortal above the perishable&mdash;in a word,
by this public acknowledgment of the Divine law, the Royal
Commissioners, in the nation&rsquo;s name, put honour on the
Sabbath of God.</p>
<p>The gorgeous fabric, whose wonders had attracted myriads of
spectators, having fulfilled its design, by exhibiting in
peaceful rivalry the products of genius, and science, and
industrial skill, collected from all nations, was ordered to be
taken down.&nbsp; Many were anxious for its preservation;
meetings were held and petitions presented to the Legislature on
the subject; but it was finally decided, by a vote of the House
of Commons, that, in accordance with the terms of the original
agreement, the structure should be removed.&nbsp; The directors
of a railway company then resolved to purchase the materials, and
reconstruct the edifice on a new site, in an improved and more
enduring <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>form, and on a scale of unprecedented magnificence and
splendour.&nbsp; In connection with this movement, a crisis most
grave and momentous has come upon us, fraught with the elements
of danger to our national Sabbath, and to that morality and
social order which largely depend on its due observance.&nbsp; It
is stated, with an air of authority, by the press, that an
application has been made to the Prime Minister of the country
for a charter of incorporation, enabling the company to open the
Crystal Palace, under Royal sanction, on the afternoon of the
Lord&rsquo;s day; that he has signified his acquiescence, and
that the responsible advisers of the Crown are prepared to
recommend the granting of the charter, with the required
licence.&nbsp; It, therefore, becomes the duty of every Christian
in the land, who rejoices in the blessed privileges of the
Sabbath, to plead for its full and faithful observance.&nbsp;
True it is that some concessions are made, in apparent deference
to the religious feelings of the community.&nbsp; It is proposed
that no train shall run before one o&rsquo;clock on the
Lord&rsquo;s day; that after that hour the public shall be
admitted only to the park and to that portion of the palace
called the Winter Garden; whilst the compartments devoted
exclusively to productions of manufacturing and commercial
industry shall be closed; and further, the directors undertake
that on the Sabbath day no spirituous liquors shall be sold in
the grounds.&nbsp; <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>But notwithstanding these plausible concessions, nay all
the more because of the false principles which I am persuaded
they involve, I still regard the proposition with abhorrence, as
opposed to an express command of Heaven, and I stand here
to-night, resolved in the strength of God to lift up a solemn
protest against it, and to urge on all who hear me the necessity
of endeavouring, by dutiful remonstrance, to prevent the
systematic violation of God&rsquo;s law under the sanction of the
executive authority of the realm.</p>
<p>There are certain leading ideas suggested by the passages I
have read, which bear upon the subject now before us.&nbsp; It is
clearly indicated that the law of God cannot be despised or
violated by any nation without bringing down upon it the
righteous judgments of Heaven (this being especially true with
regard to the transgression of the law of the Sabbath), and it is
also taught that the service which God demands is such as will
admit of no compromise, either with the claims of covetousness on
the one hand, or with the pursuit of sinful pleasure on the
other.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <i>The Law of God cannot be violated by any
nation</i>, <i>without exposing it to the righteous judgments of
Heaven</i>.&nbsp; This is a great principle repeatedly laid down
in Scripture, and fully authenticated by the facts of
history.&nbsp; It holds true with regard to individuals as well
as nations, and is abundantly illustrated by the course of events
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>in the
natural as well as in the spiritual world.&nbsp; There are fixed
laws which regulate the phenomena of the sun and the solar
system, by which the planets move in their orbits, and all derive
light and heat from the king of day; and if it were possible to
disturb this harmony by any dislocating force, then all things in
the universe would be out of place, and &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; would
&ldquo;come again.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are fixed laws, also, by
which health and life are regulated, protected, and preserved,
any violation of which brings its own punishment.&nbsp; You
cannot take up fire without being burned, for it is the property
of fire to burn; you cannot handle the venomous serpent, and
expect that it will not pierce you with its deadly fangs; for it
is the nature of the serpent&mdash;the very law of its
life&mdash;to poison and destroy.&nbsp; You cannot eat or drink
to excess, without deranging that beautiful concord of the bodily
organs which constitutes health, and bringing on yourself disease
and premature death.&nbsp; And if we turn to the spiritual world,
we shall find similar results.&nbsp; Sin is the spiritual serpent
which poisons and destroys the life of the soul.&nbsp; Extend its
baneful influence from the individual to a family, all are
brought under its blight and curse.&nbsp; And so it is of
communities and nations, which are aggregates of individuals, and
subject, in their collective capacity, to the same law.&nbsp; The
kingdoms of the earth are placed under the eye and control of Him
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>who is
Governor among the nations, and to whom they are under solemn
responsibilities.&nbsp; &ldquo;Righteousness exalteth a nation,
whilst sin is the reproach (as well as the ruin) of any
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let it not be forgotten that the Lord Jesus
Christ is &ldquo;King of nations,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;King
of saints;&rdquo; and oftentimes, in the history of the world,
have his judgments been made manifest.&nbsp; Seated on his
mediatorial throne, &ldquo;all power is given unto him in heaven
and in earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The nation or kingdom that will not
serve him &ldquo;shall be utterly wasted;&rdquo; and history, we
repeat, has fearfully attested the exercise of his dread
authority, and the vindication of his prerogative to &ldquo;root
out, to pull down, and to destroy&rdquo; the despisers of his
law.</p>
<p>Thus it was that God dealt with the heathen nations of
Canaan.&nbsp; The &ldquo;iniquity of the Amorites&rdquo; was
&ldquo;not yet full&rdquo; when He made a covenant with Abraham,
subsequently renewed to Jacob at the foot of the mystic ladder;
but the cup was filled up to overflowing when Joshua crossed the
Jordan as Heaven&rsquo;s own avenger.</p>
<p>It was so with Egypt.&nbsp; She held in iron bondage the
people of God, and clung to her abominable idolatry in the
worship of birds and beasts and creeping things.&nbsp; Even while
by the colony of shepherds, who had migrated from Palestine to
Goshen, the light of Divine truth was kindled in her midst, she
remained an impenitent rebel; and when ten plagues had wasted her
borders, and <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>sent the wail of sore bereavement in one night into every
family, the last act in the drama of Divine judgment was
consummated in that anger which whelmed the chariots and horsemen
and all the hosts of Pharaoh in the surging billows of the Red
Sea.</p>
<p>Look, again, at proud Nineveh.&nbsp; Why did she perish?&nbsp;
The answer is found in the Divine declaration, &ldquo;I will make
thy grave, for thou art vile.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, so deep did
Jehovah dig the dishonoured grave of Nineveh, that only now, at
the end of 2500 years, are her obelisks and winged
lions&mdash;her idol gods of stone, and the engraved memorials of
her battles, her sieges, and her victories, disentombed and
brought to the light of day, to the confusion of the sceptic, and
the confirmation of the &ldquo;sure word of prophecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And was it not so with Babylon&mdash;the beauty of the
Chaldees&rsquo; excellency&mdash;which God in his anger made as
Sodom and Gomorrah&mdash;a solitary waste for owls to dwell
therein, and dragons to cry in her pleasant palaces?&nbsp; And if
Tyre, once the emporium of commerce, whose &ldquo;merchants were
princes,&rdquo; and whose &ldquo;traffickers were the honourable
of the earth&rdquo;&mdash;if she has now become a rock on which
the fisherman dries his nets;&mdash;if the desolate caves and
dwellings of Petra, like the eagle&rsquo;s eyrie &ldquo;in the
sides of the rock,&rdquo; tell of what Edom once was in the day
of her glory and pride;&mdash;if the republics of Greece have
long since perished <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>under the fierce barbarism of their Moslem
invaders;&mdash;if Carthage, despite the valour of her sons and
the consummate skill of her accomplished chief, fell, trodden to
the dust beneath the iron hoof of her victorious rival,
Rome;&mdash;and if the colossal empire of Rome itself, then the
mistress of the world, has crumbled into fragments, bequeathing
to the genius of history such ample materials for the wondrous
story of her &ldquo;Decline and Fall;&rdquo;&mdash;if Attila and
Alaric were the scourges of God to hasten her downfall;&mdash;if,
later still, France and Spain and the republics of Italy have
been the scene of frightful convulsions and bloody wars, surely
these impressive lessons were written on the page of the
world&rsquo;s annals to teach us the solemn truth, that God
punishes guilty <i>nations as such</i> for the violation of his
laws&mdash;that &ldquo;verily there is a God who judgeth in the
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; If it be true, in a general sense, that the
violation of the laws of God brings wrath upon a people, we have
abundant evidence to show that the <i>violation of the law of the
Sabbath</i>, <i>in an especial and emphatic manner</i>,
<i>provokes the Divine judgments</i>.&nbsp; It was one of the
crowning acts of Israel&rsquo;s wickedness and apostasy that she
had ceased to honour the day of God; and one of the causes of the
Babylonish captivity was indicated in the awful charge, &ldquo;My
Sabbaths have they greatly polluted.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so you find
that when God assigns the period of Israel&rsquo;s bondage in a
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>strange
land, by a strong figure He represents the very soil of Canaan as
outraged by their past profanation of his holy day, and declares
that the land should have her Sabbaths&mdash;(that was when the
people should be carried away captive to Babylon)&mdash;&ldquo;as
long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies&rsquo; land,
then shall the land rest and enjoy her Sabbaths, because ye did
not rest in your Sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
how awful was the warning addressed to rebellious Israel by the
mouth of Jeremiah: &ldquo;But if ye will not hearken unto me to
hallow the Sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering
in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath-day, then will I
kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the
palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Is all this, I ask, an inexplicable mystery?&nbsp; Has it no
instruction for us?&mdash;no application to the times in which we
live&mdash;no voice of warning for our guidance?&nbsp; On the
contrary, is it not clear that the fourth commandment in the
moral law is what the keystone is to the arch&mdash;what the
heart is to the bodily frame&mdash;what the foundation is to the
building, that the observance of this commandment lies at the
very basis of national morality and national greatness?&nbsp; And
if it be wickedly violated, systematically, deliberately violated
under the sanction of human authority, in direct defiance of
Divine law, by any people, utter and irretrievable ruin must fall
on <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>that
guilty nation; the Lord of Hosts will &ldquo;break the pride of
its power,&rdquo; and bring a sword that shall &ldquo;avenge the
quarrel of his covenant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Closely connected with the profanation of this day
by Israel was <i>apostasy in religion</i>.&nbsp; They departed
from the cardinal truth of God&rsquo;s unity to the worship of
the &ldquo;gods many and lords many&rdquo; of the heathen nations
around them.&nbsp; Thus, the sanctuary being forsaken and the
Sabbath violated, they gave heed to the instruction of lying and
wicked prophets, and a flood of ungodliness was poured all over
the land.&nbsp; And even after their return from bondage, the
leaven of their wickedness remained&mdash;idolatrous alliances,
intermarriages with heathen nations, and other crimes, are
connected in the sacred history with Sabbath profanation.&nbsp;
Hence, Nehemiah, the bold Reformer, records how he contended with
the people and even with the nobles of Judah, and how, testifying
against their sin, he said unto them, &ldquo;What evil thing is
this ye do and profane the Sabbath day?&nbsp; Did not your
fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and
upon this city?&nbsp; Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by
profaning the Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, it is precisely so with regard to the Christian
Sabbath.&nbsp; A system of spurious Christianity has mutilated it
by the sanction of secular occupations and sinful pleasures on
that holy day.&nbsp; Romanism, in its ritual and service, is, in
itself, a <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>blasphemous worship&mdash;its mass idolatry&mdash;its
priests usurpers of the prerogative of Christ, &ldquo;the Great
High Priest of our profession,&rdquo; and teachers not of the
Gospel of Christ, but of &ldquo;another gospel&rdquo;&mdash;the
devotions of her people are not simple, spiritual, and
Bible-taught, but the offspring of fear marked by superstition
and self-righteousness, and by the vain repetition of prayers to
those who are no more gods than were the dumb idols of ancient
Paganism.&nbsp; But, in addition to this, Popery has made void
the law of God, the law of the Sabbath, by her traditions, and
that in two ways.&mdash;1st, She has dragged down this blessed
day of God from that place of peculiar glory and grandeur, where
Jehovah himself has enthroned it above every other day, and has
degraded it to a level with the feasts and fasts of the Romish
calendar, making her own numerous holidays of equal authority
with the Holy Day of God&rsquo;s appointment.&nbsp; The
consequence is, that, in all Popish countries, the holidays are
better observed than the Sabbath, just because superstition and
will-worship are dear to the carnal heart.</p>
<p>2nd, She has robbed the law of God of its complete and
permanent authority.&nbsp; She has contracted the Scriptural
limits of the Sabbath, and made it a <i>half</i> instead of a
<i>whole</i> Sabbath.&nbsp; Hence, when the Popish mass is over
at noon, the remaining portion of the day is regarded as a
holiday.&nbsp; I <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>speak not here of countries like our own, where she
accommodates herself to the religious feelings and habits of the
community, but of countries where she holds paramount sway.&nbsp;
There one-half of the Sabbath is devoted to amusement and
sensuous, if not sensual enjoyment.&nbsp; Before famine and
pestilence swept the neighbouring island as with &ldquo;the besom
of destruction,&rdquo; crowds of the population might be found on
the Sabbath playing at the game of football, wrestling in the
meadow, or drinking and dancing in the public-house, whilst many
of the priests were wont, as I have reason to know, to spend the
evening of the Sabbath in gay society, and shared in card-playing
and carousal.&nbsp; And when we look to France&mdash;the military
review, the brilliant f&ecirc;te, the opening of a railway, take
place on the Sabbath, while the population of Paris is divided
between the attractions of Versailles, the Luxembourg, and the
Louvre, and the numerous theatres which are thrown open by
authority for those who are &ldquo;lovers of pleasure more than
lovers of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we go to Rome, the centre and source of that gigantic
superstition which flings its dark shadows over the continent of
Europe, we find public &ldquo;lotteries&rdquo; in active
operation on the Sabbath, over which cardinals themselves
preside.&nbsp; And in Madrid, after mass is over, the Queen of
Spain, surrounded by multitudes of her people, is present at the
cruel and revolting bull-fight.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>And
thus it is everywhere the spirit of Popery to mutilate the
Sabbath.&nbsp; If it be said this laxity prevails also in
Protestant countries of the continent, for this a twofold reason
may be assigned:&mdash;first, because the German Reformers, not
excepting Luther himself, gave an uncertain sound on the
obligations of the Sabbath, and retained so much of the system
they had abandoned as to leave to their countrymen a low and
imperfect standard of Sabbath observance; and, above all, because
the spirit of the Reformation is dead in Germany, Rationalism has
taken the place of Evangelism, and &ldquo;the salt has lost its
savour.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is encouraging to know that, wherever
evangelical truth has been revived on the continent, there also
is waking up a corresponding zeal for the sanctification of the
Lord&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Popery, then, has always robbed God of half his own day; and
wherever this sacrilege is perpetrated, His judgments have been
poured forth.&nbsp; As is attested by the history of Israel in
the days of old, as well as by that of France, and Italy, and
Spain, and of our own country in the days of the Stuarts, when
semi-Popery tyrannised over its victims in the oppression and
murder of the Covenanters of Scotland and of the Puritans of
England, when the first Charles perished on the scaffold after
long and bloody civil wars, and the second Charles, (whose
personal profligacy almost corrupted a whole nation, and who, as
Pepys <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>so
graphically records,) was smitten by the hand of death as he sat,
surrounded by his paramours, at the gambling-table, on the
Sabbath eve, in &ldquo;that glorious gallery&rdquo; of Whitehall
Palace; in the judgments that came upon dynasties and nations, as
such, at these and other periods in connexion with Sabbath
desecration&mdash;we are forcibly reminded that the &ldquo;Lord
of the Sabbath day,&rdquo; seated at the Father&rsquo;s right
hand, can, as the divine word so awfully expresses it,
&ldquo;strike through kings in the day of His wrath,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dash&rdquo; His enemies &ldquo;in pieces like a
potter&rsquo;s vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole Sabbath, then, belongs to God; we claim the whole of
it for the concerns of the soul and of eternity, and any secular
infringement of it must be an act of rebellion against the
sovereignty of the Most High.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; <i>The Sabbath law admits of no compromise either
with the claims of covetousness on the one hand</i>, <i>or of
sinful pleasure on the other</i>.&nbsp; Not with covetousness,
for it is written, &ldquo;Ye cannot serve God and
Mammon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Often have such compromises been attempted
by individuals and by communities, but upon them the God of
heaven has ever frowned.&nbsp; Ye railway directors, who
overwhelm with a storm of ridicule the faithful few who oppose
the running of trains on the Sabbath day, what &ldquo;fruit have
ye had&rdquo; even as to success in your speculations?&nbsp; Ye
&ldquo;looked for much, and lo! it came to little;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;why?&rdquo; <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>saith the Lord of Hosts; &ldquo;because I did blow upon
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And are there now men who, while they call their
palace &ldquo;the people&rsquo;s palace,&rdquo; and themselves
&ldquo;the poor man&rsquo;s friends,&rdquo; yet depend mainly on
<i>the poor man&rsquo;s shillings</i> to swell their
dividends?&nbsp; &ldquo;O! my soul; come not thou into their
secret, unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou
united!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither, again, will this law of the Sabbath &ldquo;shake
hands&rdquo; with those who &ldquo;are lovers of pleasure more
than lovers of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From such&rdquo; an
inspired apostle commands us to &ldquo;<i>turn
away</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you consider a whole Sabbath spent
devoutly &ldquo;a weariness,&rdquo; and say, &ldquo;When will it
be over?&rdquo;&mdash;if you prove by your practice that your
attendance on the sanctuary during one part of the Sabbath is
regarded by you as a kind of licence to spend the rest of the day
in &ldquo;doing your own pleasure,&rdquo; then be assured that
you furnish a fearful evidence that you are destitute of the
spiritual tastes of &ldquo;the new creature,&rdquo; and that you
are still &ldquo;in the gall of bitterness and the bond of
iniquity!&rdquo;&nbsp; And let none say that we desire to make
the Sabbath a day of gloom and not of gladness.&nbsp; We desire
that it should be consecrated to that God whose &ldquo;ways are
pleasantness,&rdquo; and because it is &ldquo;the day which the
Lord hath made&rdquo; to exult in its refreshing remembrances, in
its blessed privileges, and in its <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>hallowed anticipations.&nbsp; And
thus counting the Sabbath &ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">A
DELIGHT</span>,&rdquo; the Christian can exclaim,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O
day most calm and bright,<br />
The fruit of this, the next world&rsquo;s bud;<br />
The endorsement of supreme delight<br />
Writ by a Friend, and with his blood;<br />
The couch of time; care&rsquo;s balm and bay;<br />
The week were dark but for thy light,<br />
Thy torch doth show the way!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>V.&nbsp; There are <i>pleas urged on behalf of this movement
which demand our notice</i>.&nbsp; It may be said that
&ldquo;there are already laws on the Statute Book which license
the opening of public-houses, the running of railway trains and
of steam-boats, and that the sale of Sunday newspapers, and of a
host of penny publications, many of which are most noxious in
their tendency, is also sanctioned.&rdquo;&nbsp; We reply that
all such laws are unholy, Popish and not Protestant in their
spirit and tendency, and that they directly assail the authority
and perpetual obligation of the Divine law which says,
&ldquo;Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was in the true spirit of the Reformation that the Founders of
the Church of England instructed the minister to rehearse
publicly the fourth commandment, and the people to respond,
&ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep
this law.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not from Puritanical strictness or
Scottish bigotry, so called, but because the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Bible was
their pole-star, and the glory of God their aim, that the
Assembly of Divines at Westminster, in their &ldquo;Shorter
Catechism,&rdquo; taught the child to say, &ldquo;The Sabbath is
to be sanctified by a holy resting <i>all that day</i>, even from
such recreations and employments as are lawful on other days, and
the spending <i>the whole time</i> in the public and private
exercise of God&rsquo;s worship, except so much as shall be taken
up in the works of necessity and mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we may be told, again, that &ldquo;the Sabbath is a Jewish
institution.&rdquo;&nbsp; We marvel that any should practically
forget that the law of the Sabbath occupied a place on those
tables of stone on which the Great Lawgiver inscribed a law with
His own finger, which had nothing ceremonial, Jewish, or national
in their aspect, which was constituted for all time, and which
the Great Author of the New Testament dispensation declared that
He &ldquo;came not to destroy, but to fulfil.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
merely ceremonial institution, no &ldquo;<i>positive</i>&rdquo;
and transitory law, could have had penalties so awful, or
blessings so precious annexed to it, as we find attached to the
Sabbath, and that before the advent of the Messiah, and
throughout the whole course of Jewish national history.&nbsp;
Born as the institution itself was, so to speak, in Paradise;
recognised by patriarchs from Noah onward, as indicated by the
division of time into weeks; lost and trampled down under the
hoof of <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>slavery in Egypt (as it has ever been where slavery has
prevailed), but experiencing a resurrection in the wilderness,
where Israel was free to serve and sacrifice, to worship and give
praise to their fathers&rsquo; God&mdash;Sinai&rsquo;s thunders
but gave awful sanction and permanent establishment to a
&ldquo;law&rdquo; which from the beginning had its moral claims
over the whole race, and which, irrespective of all typical
institutions, was intended for the race as such, and was thus
emphatically &ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">MADE FOR
MAN</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the Christian dispensation, the seventh portion of time
is still consecrated to God, the change of the day but adding a
higher and holier lustre and sanction to the Sabbath than it ever
possessed before, because it commemorates the resurrection of Him
by whom Paradise is to be restored, and who has declared from His
throne, &ldquo;Behold, I make all things new.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
own example and that of His Apostles, as well as of the churches
formed by them, and the honour put on &ldquo;the Queen of
days&rdquo; (as Justin Martyr calls it), by the primitive Church,
reminds us that the Lord&rsquo;s-day claims <i>our</i> homage,
<i>our</i> devout and holy observance, too; and that just in
proportion as we hallow it, shall we &ldquo;sanctify the Lord God
in our hearts,&rdquo; and conform our practice to the pristine
model of all that is &ldquo;pure, and lovely, and of good
report,&rdquo; as well as bring down upon our families and upon
our country the blessing of Him <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>who is the Governor of nations.&nbsp;
No human government, no earthly ruler, therefore, can set aside,
or abrogate, or modify the requirements of this law, so as to
limit its sacred hours virtually to the half of the scriptural
standard, without pouring contempt on the very statute-book of
Heaven!</p>
<p>It may be further said that, under the Gospel Dispensation,
&ldquo;the strictness of its observance is relaxed because
capital punishment is not to be inflicted on its transgressors,
as of old.&rdquo;&nbsp; We reply that, in the instance cited,
capital punishment was inflicted under a theocracy (by God
Himself, as the <span class="smcap">Immediate Governor</span> of
Israel), and that this was an emblem of that sore and everlasting
punishment&mdash;that death eternal, which will surely overtake
the impenitent transgressors of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Again: the apologist for the relaxation of Sabbath observance
may take shelter under the authority of the Apostle to the
Gentiles, and plead that we are free to act as we please, because
Paul says, &ldquo;One man esteemeth one day above another,
another esteemeth every day alike.&nbsp; Let every man be fully
persuaded in his own mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we reply, that this
passage has special reference to the <i>feast days</i>, which
some Jewish converts to Christianity thought binding, and others
did not; and which the Apostle, in a catholic spirit, left to the
discretion of each individual, as <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>conscience might dictate.&nbsp; In
the same spirit he says to the Colossians, &ldquo;Let no man
judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or
of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days, which are a shadow of
things to come, but the body is Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, the
Sabbath days here mentioned as not imperatively binding were the
<i>seventh-day</i> Sabbaths, and not the <i>first day</i> of the
week, the Christian Sabbath, commemorative of the <i>New
Creation</i>, when God the Son finished the work of Redemption,
as God the Father on the seventh day ended the works which He had
made.</p>
<p>And here an objector may say, &ldquo;if the command is to be
strictly fulfilled, the <i>seventh day</i> should be
observed.&rdquo;&nbsp; That such an objection should be put
forward by any professing Christian is indeed strange.&nbsp; For
the change from the seventh to the first day of the week, we have
the example of Christ and the Apostles, and the command is in
spirit and in truth obeyed by dedicating to the service of God a
<i>seventh portion of time</i>, that portion in the Christian
Church being the first day of the week.&nbsp; In point of fact,
it is impossible that identically the same hours can be set apart
for Sabbath observance in every part of the world.&nbsp; The sun
that sets on Calcutta rises on the towers of Quebec.&nbsp; If two
ships leave England, and sail round the globe by different
routes, they will have lost a day in their reckoning; the seventh
day of the one will be the first of the <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>other.&nbsp;
But amidst these variations, arising from the earth&rsquo;s
motion, the Sabbath remains an immutable institute and ordinance
of Heaven.&nbsp; It still continues of Divine authority and of
perpetual obligation.&nbsp; Under the gospel it is accompanied
with fresh claims on our reverence and regard, and it is set
apart under the most solemn sanctions for the worship of
Jehovah&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Further, it may be pleaded that &ldquo;it is unjust for those
who have leisure and opportunity during the week, to object to
the opening of the Crystal Palace on part of the Sabbath, while
the masses have no other season for relaxation from daily toil,
or for inspecting the wonders of nature and art.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Still we urge the command, &ldquo;Remember the Sabbath-day to
keep it holy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The day, the whole day, belongs to
God; and he has solemnly said, &ldquo;I hate robbery for burnt
offering.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lord of the Sabbath day has declared
that &ldquo;the Sabbath was made for man&rdquo;&mdash;yes, and
emphatically for the poor man.&nbsp; It is his, as an immortal
and responsible being, and his devout observance of it can alone
make it to him a blessing and not a curse.&nbsp; It is thus that
the poor of this world are to be made &ldquo;rich in faith, and
heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love
Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>In the estimate of God</i>, <i>one day in
seven is not too much for either poor or rich to prepare for
eternity</i>.</p>
<p>But in truth this plea is the subterfuge of eager <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>covetousness.&nbsp; While we honour the character and
labours of many Christian philanthropists among our merchants and
men of business, it cannot be denied that this is a
mammon-getting age, and that it is culpably careless of the
poor.&nbsp; We desire and plead for fresh air and relaxation for
the poor.&nbsp; But it is not by this new plan they can be
rightfully secured.&nbsp; Let us see the poor man&rsquo;s home
made comfortable and cleanly; let us cheer on the philanthropic
labours of Sabbath-schools, Ragged-schools, and City missions;
let us have our workmen&rsquo;s wages paid on <i>Friday</i>, and
not at public-houses; and (as was once the case in Scotland,
under the sanction alike of custom and of law) let labour cease
early on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; The poor man will thus have
ample leisure furnished him to survey the works of nature, or the
wonders of art, and breathe the fresh air.&nbsp; Let this be as
the preparation for the Sabbath, on whose enclosure neither
labour nor pleasure may intrude, because it is &ldquo;holy
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another plea remains to be considered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
tendency of this exhibition (it is said) will be to elevate and
purify the mind.&nbsp; Art, and science, and taste, will educate
and reform; they will empty the public-houses, and wean the
people from gross indulgence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still, we say, the day
is God&rsquo;s, and we are not to do evil that good may
come.&nbsp; Shut up the public houses, and they cannot be
filled.&nbsp; Close those railways, and stop <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>those
steam-boats from plying the river, which now allure multitudes
from the house of God on the Sabbath.&nbsp; Let us <i>abolish
unscriptural laws</i>, instead of filling up the measure of our
iniquity by a crowning act of guilt.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sights of
the Crystal Palace will educate and purify!&rdquo;&nbsp; Why,
when vice loses its grossness, has it necessarily lost its
power?&nbsp; Is it true that statuary and painting, and works of
art and genius, can refine and regenerate men?&nbsp; In their own
place we despise them not.&nbsp; They bring honour to the great
Creator, who is the source of all excellence in genius and
skill.&nbsp; But they cannot change the heart, or quicken the
conscience, or prepare for eternity.&nbsp; And be assured, that
if the Crystal Palace be opened on the Lord&rsquo;s day, and
fifty or sixty thousand spectators be admitted, the
nation&rsquo;s morality will be undermined more surely and more
rapidly than ever it was before.&nbsp; What though the use of
spirituous liquors be strictly prohibited <i>within</i> the
grounds, facilities for obtaining drink <i>without</i> will
increase on every hand.&nbsp; Sunday trading will receive a fresh
impetus, and the afternoon spent by tens of thousands in these
excursions of pleasure, our churches will be emptied and our
domestic circles broken up; while, in the train of these evils,
personal demoralization will inevitably follow.&nbsp; In this
downward career we may, ere long, descend to the position of
France.&nbsp; There public galleries are thrown open on the <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Sabbath, and
the multitude stands entranced in admiration before the
sculptures and the paintings of the great masters of art.&nbsp;
But this people, so polished, and so joyous, are strangers to
that deep-toned earnestness and gravity which makes a nation
great through the inspiring hopes of a life immortal and
divine;&mdash;they are &ldquo;filled with all
unrighteousness,&rdquo; and, in times of political excitement,
amid scenes of cruelty and savage violence, they give awful proof
that &ldquo;they have no fear of God before their
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new Crystal Palace, now in progress in the neighbourhood
of this metropolis, is to be a spacious temple, dedicated to
science and art, in which all that is ingenious and beautiful and
rare may be exhibited for the improvement and intellectual
gratification of the people.&nbsp; This is an object which
assuredly every enlightened Christian would applaud and approve,
if confined within the limits which Scripture prescribes.&nbsp;
We consider it most desirable that facilities should be afforded
to our population devoutly to contemplate the works of God, as in
glory and beauty they have sprung from his plastic hand, and to
survey the marvellous productions of that genius and skill of
which He is the Divine original.&nbsp; We believe, science and
learning and art, even now, are so many pioneers preparing the
way of the Lord; and that at the period when the religion of the
cross shall triumph, they will bring all their trophies and lay
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>them down
at Emmanuel&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; But, my brethren, before that day
can come, science, genius, learning, and art, must be
&ldquo;baptized and sanctified:&rdquo; they must be subordinated
to the progress of the Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom.&nbsp; And sure I
am, that if they are put in the place of religion&mdash;if they
are brought into collision with, and antagonism to a law that is
alike immutable and divine&mdash;if they arrogate to themselves
half the day which belongs exclusively and entirely to Him who is
Lord of the Sabbath&mdash;if, in the language of impious
presumption, they say, &ldquo;we have a fane as holy as the
Christian temple&mdash;our claims to impart instruction are equal
to those who preach the gospel to the poor, and who speak of
death and judgment, of heaven and hell&rdquo;&mdash;then, I say,
science however profound, genius however soaring, art however
exquisitely skilful, put forward blasphemous claims; and if we,
as a nation, from deference to their pretensions, sanction the
public profanation of any portion of the Sabbath, &ldquo;our root
shall be as rottenness, and our blossom shall go up as dust,
because we shall have cast away the law of the Lord of Hosts, and
despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it may be further said, &ldquo;that the working classes
should not be debarred from bodily rest and relaxation on the
Lord&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cheerfully grant it; but we
deny that the opponents of the opening of the Crystal Palace on
the Sabbath <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>seek to deprive the working man of his Sabbath&rsquo;s
bodily rest from toil.&nbsp; How great the difference between the
two classes of working men&mdash;those who &ldquo;rest according
to the commandment,&rdquo; who repair in clean and decent garb to
the house of God morning and evening, and spend the intervals of
public worship in reading and meditation, or in the instruction
of the young.&nbsp; We ask you by personal examination to
contrast the refreshment both of mind and body with which this
class return to their work on Monday morning, with the jaded
spirits, the shattered nerves of the frequenters of steam-boats,
the occupants of excursion-trains, the patrons of the tea-garden
and the public-house, who go back to labour unrefreshed and
unblessed, and too often the victims of surfeiting, drunkenness,
and riotous excess.&nbsp; And are we to be told that such an
argument is invalid in the present case, because no spirituous
liquors are to be sold within the park or the palace on the
Lord&rsquo;s day; when (as present preparations <i>without</i>
the walls clearly indicate) we know that the gin-palace and the
public-house will thrive and prosper on the traffic of multitudes
who will enter them <i>first</i> and visit them <i>last</i>, and
without whose unhallowed stimulants the sculpture, the flowers,
and the fountains would lose half their charms?</p>
<p>And, moreover, instead of Sabbath rest, will not the opening
of this building on the Lord&rsquo;s day lead to <i>a vast
increase of Sabbath labour</i>?&nbsp; Must <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>there not be
a large addition to the staff of railway officials, as well as of
police, required, not only on the main line of traffic, but also
to attend to, to accommodate, or to keep in order the multitudes
who, by excursion-trains on other lines, will fill our streets
and crowd our public vehicles on their way to this scene of
profanation?</p>
<p>And now, let me conclude by calling on all Christians to come
forward without delay, and to raise a loud, united, and solemn
protest against this iniquitous project.</p>
<p>If this Protestant nation speak out boldly and decidedly, we
do not see that any Minister of the Crown will despise the
remonstrance and the warning.&nbsp; And, most of all, we are
strong in the confidence, that if the <i>real</i> tendency of
this measure is fully explained to our gracious Queen, and if she
find that it is disapproved of and abjured by the great religious
bodies of the empire, she will not rashly imperil our safety, or
be the instrument of establishing a Popish and a divided
Sabbath.</p>
<p>Can we, I ask, afford to despise the authority of the Supreme
Ruler of the Universe?&nbsp; If He has visited us already with
famine and pestilence, two of His &ldquo;sore judgments,&rdquo;
why may He not, if we persist in rebelling with a high hand,
permit us to know, also, the horrors of &ldquo;war,&rdquo; and
that from the presence of an invading foe?&nbsp; There may be
some who trust with confidence to our <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>wooden walls and to our disciplined
armies; but we, even while remembering their past achievements
and undying renown, dare not do so.&nbsp; If the present ruler of
France has boldly resolved to imitate, step by step, the policy
of his great and ambitious uncle; and if, as is confidently said,
he cherishes with bitter hate the memory of the bloody field
where the star of Napoleon&rsquo;s destiny set for ever; who can
tell (if we provoke God to desert us) whether he may not be
permitted to make an assault on our island home, which for a time
would paralyse our commerce, outrage our liberties, and stain the
pride of our boasting confidence in the sight of the whole
world?</p>
<p>May that God, before whom our fathers did walk, save us from
the guilt which would draw down His vengeance.&nbsp; May He
increase among us the number of those whose patriotism is
animated and directed by Christian principle.&nbsp; May He give
&ldquo;peace in our borders, and fill us with the finest of the
wheat.&rdquo;&nbsp; May He be &ldquo;a wall of fire around us,
and the glory in the midst!&rdquo;&nbsp; May he give us grace as
a nation so to keep His own Day, that we may reap the blessing
with which he has promised to crown its faithful observance:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">If thou turn away thy
foot from the sabbath</span>, <span class="smcap">from doing thy
pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight</span>,
<span class="smcap">the holy of the Lord</span>, <span

<h2>NOTE.</h2>
<p>The Rev. D. Moore, in a note to his sermon &ldquo;Our Sabbaths
in Danger,&rdquo; quotes the following statement, supplied to him
from a source which may be &ldquo;implicitly relied
on.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There are no less than seven
public-houses now in course of erection, or about to be erected,
near the Crystal Palace, one of which is to cost &pound;30,000,
and to contain stabling for 500 horses, tea-gardens,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The road leading from Anerly is literally thronged
from ten to six o&rsquo;clock every Sunday, and persons of all
grades are to be seen there, some selling by the way side, others
gambling; and in the roads on either sides of the way scenes of
the most revolting nature are taking place in open daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A labouring man, some two or three months since, took a
small cottage and large garden in the Anerly road, and opened it
as a beer-house and tea-gardens, and he now has from <i>four to
five hundred persons</i> in his ground on the Sabbath day.&nbsp;
Many more particulars of a like kind might be added, but with
great difficulty, owing to the <i>secrecy observed by all
parties</i>.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
